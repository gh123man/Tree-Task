Tree Task
=========

Tree Task is a nested task management app for the Android operating system. 

## About

I created tree task because I needed a project/task/to-do manager that could handle large projects and notes while maintaining an effective UI. 
Tree Task manages data in a tree structure - Like files and folders.
Your progress on tasks/projects is tracked by calculating the completion of each sub-task in each sub-tree and sending its score to its parent. Then it is displayed in a handy progress bar.

## Features
- create nested tasks (like a to-do list)
- tasks may also be used as notes (50k characters per task description)
- export tasks to any other app (email, text message...)
- archive for finished tasks
- progress tracking by calculating completion of all sub-tasks.
- full tree view mode - visualize the entire tree and jump to any task (see screenshots)


### Why open source?

This app is for sale on Google play. I figure if someone wants to support my work or simply want consistent updates they will buy it. But I don't want put a pay-wall between developers or power-user who really love the app!
I am a strong believer in open source software and feel that public exposure can only make a platform better. 

### Can I try it first?
